Hi, I am **Mengyu Zhao**, a PhD student in [ECE at Rutgers University](https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/), advised by [Prof. Shirin Jalali](https://sites.google.com/site/shirinjalali/home). I work on **visual restoration with image priors** and **LLM/MLLM agents and efficiency**. Before starting my PhD, I earned my BE from [Xi’an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) and my MS from [Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/).  

I am always happy to chat and collaborate. We have a [reading group](https://sites.google.com/view/readinggroupforinverseprob/about) on deep learning for inverse problems. I also interned at [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/what-we-do/engineering-cto/) in summer 2025, working on a GUI LLM agent project.
