Hi! I’m **Mengyu Zhao**, a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [**Rutgers University**](https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [**Prof. Shirin Jalali**](https://sites.google.com/site/shirinjalali/home). My research focuses on **visual restoration using image priors** and the development of **efficient LLM/MLLM agents**.

I am currently an intern at **TikTok Inc.**, focusing on efficient vision encoders. Previously, I spent the summer of 2025 as an intern at [**Bloomberg**](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/what-we-do/engineering-cto/), where I developed GUI-based LLM agents. I hold a BE from [Xi’an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) and an MS from [Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/).

I’m always open to technical discussions and collaboration. I also help organize a [reading group](https://sites.google.com/view/readinggroupforinverseprob/about) dedicated to deep learning for inverse problems.
