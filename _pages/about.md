Hi, I’m Mengyu Zhao, currently a third-year PhD student in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rutgers University](https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/), where I am advised by Prof. [Shirin Jalali](https://sites.google.com/site/shirinjalali/home). Before that, I earned my master’s degree in Statistics at Rutgers, working with Prof. [Sijian Wang](https://sites.rutgers.edu/sijian-wang/), and my bachelor’s degree from Xi'an Jiaotong University under the guidance of Prof. [Xiaohu Yang](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/xiaohuyang).

My research background includes Computational Imaging, Inverse Problems, and Statistical Machine Learning. Currently, I am focusing on developing theoretical guarantees and efficient machine learning algorithms for modern computational imaging inverse problems, such as Snapshot Compressive Imaging.

This semester, we are also organizing a [reading group](https://sites.google.com/view/readinggroupforinverseprob/about) that explores topics in deep learning and inverse problems. I’m always open to collaborations. Feel free to reach out if you’d like to discuss or work together.

Outside of academia, I’m passionate about tennis and hiking⛰. Let me know if you'd like to hit the courts for a rally sometime!
