Hi, I am Mengyu Zhao, a PhD student in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at Rutgers University](https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/) where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Shirin Jalali](https://sites.google.com/site/shirinjalali/home). 

Some research topics I am excited include: 
  - **Visual Restoration** with image priors
  - **LLM/MLLM** agents and efficiency

Before starting my PhD, I got BE from [Xi'an Jiaotong University (XJTU)](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) and MS from [Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/).

_I am always open to discussions and collaborations—please feel free to reach out!_ This semester, I am organizing a [reading group](https://sites.google.com/view/readinggroupforinverseprob/about) focusing on deep learning and inverse problems.

I have done research internship at [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/what-we-do/engineering-cto/) during summer 2025.
