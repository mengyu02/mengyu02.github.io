Hi, I am Mengyu Zhao, a third-year PhD student in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), Rutgers University](https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/). I’m fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Shirin Jalali](https://sites.google.com/site/shirinjalali/home). Before my PhD, I got Bachelor’s degree from [Xi'an Jiaotong University (XJTU)](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/).

My research interests primarily focus on **Visual Restoration**, **Multimodal LLMs**.

_I am always open to discussions and collaborations—please feel free to reach out!_ This semester, I am organizing a [reading group](https://sites.google.com/view/readinggroupforinverseprob/about) focusing on deep learning and inverse problems. Outside of academia, I enjoy playing tennis and hiking. 

I will be joining [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/what-we-do/engineering-cto/) for student internship during summer 2025.
