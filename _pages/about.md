Hi, I am Mengyu Zhao, a third-year PhD student in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), Rutgers University](https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/), working with Prof. [Shirin Jalali](https://sites.google.com/site/shirinjalali/home).

My research interests inlclude **Inverse Problems**, **Sensing and Reconstruction**, **LLM**, etc.  
- **Reconstruction**: Exploring theoretical limits and developing robust algorithms (generative model, implicit prior...)
- **LLM**: Improving efficiency in vision-LLM

Before my PhD, I got Master’s in Statistics at Rutgers University and Bachelor’s degree from [Xi'an Jiaotong University (XJTU)](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Xiaohu Yang](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/xiaohuyang).

I am always open to discussions and collaborations—please feel free to reach out! This semester, I am organizing a [reading group](https://sites.google.com/view/readinggroupforinverseprob/about) focusing on deep learning and inverse problems.

Outside of academia, I enjoy playing tennis and hiking. Let me know if you would like to meet up for a tennis rally!
